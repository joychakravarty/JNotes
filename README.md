# JNotes

## Description:
  This is a desktop application which allows quick-access/lookup to your key-value-info type of data. 
  Example: 
  Key: "Prd hostname"  Value: "yxz123"  Info: ""
  Key: "Acceptance Webapp url"  Value: "https://accServer:8445/mywebapp"  Info: "notEncryptedNotImportantPassword"

  (Or you may want to have a profile for learning Dutch language like word-meaning-setences)
  Key: "snel"  Value: "fast"  Info: "JNotes is fast \n JNotes is snel"

  Usually I use OneNote and have a table to store this kind of data but I use OneNote for other daily activity as well like   jotting down my analysis of a Prod Issue, during this time I do not wish to move away from this page to find my "Acceptance Webapp url", this is why I built JNotes, its my lookup table!
  
## Why JNotes:
  - It's keyboard friendly. TIP: Use shortcuts as much as possible, I built it for Keyboard poeple like me
  - lookup table without fast search is no fun, so JNotes is quick. try it.
  - It's a Java based application so yes you can run the .jar on your machine without much hassle.
  - Its open source - https://github.com/joychakravarty/JNotes/edit/master/README.md - so fork it and customize it.
